    <p class = "text"> Everything around us can be catergorized on their chemical composition as 1 of 3 things: a pure element,a compound or a Mixture <br>
    <img src="../Images/Substance.png" class="pictureStyle">
    <br>
     There are 2 broad classifications. A mixture, and a non-mixture. A non-mixture can be further classified into 2 different types: an element or a compound.
      Starting with the element, it is a material that consists atoms of a single type (eg: Iron nail). A compound is an element where instead of being made up of atoms, it is made up of a combination of various atoms chemically combined.
       Finally we have mixtures, which are simply elements and compounds mixed together without any chemical interaction between the constituent materials.
    <br>
    An element is made up of atoms. The idea of an atom was created to represent the smallest fundamental thing that can be found in nature. Overall only 5 models became popular,
    with only 2, the Bohr model and the quantum model being used nowadays.

        <h3 class="card-title"> 1.1 Atoms and their isotopes</h3>
        <p class="card-text"> An atom consists of 3 main parts: protons (a charge of +1), electrons (a charge of -1) and neutrons. </p>
        <img src="../Images/atomBohr.webp" class="cardPic">
        <p class="card-text"> Each element has a certain number of protons, electrons and protons which can be read off their entry on the periodic table.</p>
        <img src="../Images/Magnesium periodic table.jpg" class="cardPic"> <br>
        <p class="card-text"> In the case of Magnesium: <br>
            The number of protons (as given at the top) = 12 <br>
            The number of electrons (since it's neutral) = 12 <br>
            Finally we have the number at the bottom which represents the Average atomic mass. The atomic mass of an elememt can be calculated by adding the weight of the protons and the neutrons. Considering that the atomic mass for this element is 24 atomic grams, the number of neutropns would be 12.
            <br>
            <br>
            Note: It is important to note that this is just the average of various instances where the number of neutrons in each instance is different. Samples which have different number of neutrons but have the same electric composition (same number of protons) are called as isotopes.

        <h5 class = "card-title"> Electrostatic Force</h5>
        <p class="card-text"> To calculate the electrostatic force exerted between 2 different charged particles, one can use coumbn's law. <br>
            <img src ="../Images/Columbn's formula.webp" ><br>
            In this picture: <br>
            q<sub>1</sub> and q<sub>2</sub> represent the electric charge of the 2 particles.<br>
            F is the electrostatic force exerted between the two <br>
            k is columbn's constant <br>
            and r is the distance between the two particles.

            In a similar fashion, we can also calculate the individual electrical field exerted by a single charged particle using the formula:<br>
            <img src="../Images/electric field.png" style = "height:200px"> <br>
            Over here the 2nd charge is eliminated, and we get the direct value for the electric field.</p>

        <h5 class = "card-title"> Energy shells</h5>
            <p> Some time after the Bohr model, Schrodinger released his quantum model which tried to predict the most probable location of electron inside the atoms. The places where electrons are most likely to be found are referred to as orbitals
                and the shape,number and orientation of these orbitals changes depending on the quantum configurations of the atom. <br>
                <img src = "../Images/orbitals.jpg" class = "cardPic">
                <br>
                To easily calculate the orbital configuration of the atom, we can use the atomic Quantum mechanic model of electronic configuration. 
                In this model, an orbital can be described on the basis of it's distance from the nucleus and its sublevel. <br>
                <br>

                <img src = "../Images/orbitals diagram.png" class="cardPic"> <br>

                There are also several rules for filling up these orbitals: <br>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Aufbau principle: Electrons enter orbitals of lowest energy first.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Pauli exclusion principle: An atomic orbital may describe at most two electrons. To occupy the same orbital, the two electrons must have opposite spins. (shown as arrows)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hundâ€™s rule: When occupying  orbitals of equal energy, only one electron may fill each orbital until all the orbitals contain one electron of the same  spin -- then a second electron of opposite spin may be added.
                </li>
